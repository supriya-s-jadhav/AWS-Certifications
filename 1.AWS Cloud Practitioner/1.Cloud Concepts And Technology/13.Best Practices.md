# Best Practices

Traditional Computing vs Cloud computing

1. IT assets as Provisioned Resources
2. Global, Available and scalable Capacity
3. Higher Level Managed Services
4. Built-in Security
5. Architecting For Costs
6. Operations on AWS

## Different Design Principals:

#### 1. Scalability

1.1 Scale up: Increasing the amount of RAM or CPU.

1.2 Scale out: Far common thing:
    a. Stateless Application. Example: Alexa (Lambda).
    b. Distribute Load to multiple Nodes
    c. Stateless Components
    d. Stateful Components (Saving data like using RDS)
    e. Implement Session Affinity
    f. Distributed Processing
    g. Implement Distributed Processing

#### 2. Disposable Resources Instead of Fixed Servers

2.1 Instantiating Compute Resources:
    a. Bootstraping
    b. Golden Images
    c. Containers
    d. Hybrid

2.2 Infrastructure As Code:
    a. CloudFormation

#### 3. Automation:

3.1 Serverless Management And Deployment (CodePipeline, CodeDeploy)

3.2 Infrastructure Management And Deployment
    a. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    b. Amazon EC2 auto recovery
    c. AWS Systems Manager
    d. Auto Scaling

#### 4. Automation

4.1 Alarms and Events
    a. Amazon cloudWatch alarms
    b. Amazon CloudWatch Events
    c. AWS Lambda scheduled events
    d. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) security automation. Can respond to something that is trying to attack your web application.

#### 5. Loose Coupling

5.1 Well Defined Interfaces
    a. Amazon API Gateway

5.2 Service Discovery
    a. Implement Service Discovery

5.3 Asynchronous Integration
    a. Tight coupling (procedural programming)
    b. Loose Coupling (independent phases using queues)

5.4 Distributed Systems Best Practices
    a. Graceful Failure in Practice

#### 6. Services Not Servers

6.1. Managed Services (Lambda, S3, Route53) meaning not replying on physical services

6.2 Serverless Architecture

#### 7. Databases

7.1 Relational Databases (Aurora)
    a. It is scalable, you will have 6 copies of your data spread across 3 AZs
    b. High Availability:  Multi-AZ
    c. Anti-Patterns: No need for joins or complex transactions, use No-SQL

7.2 Non-Relational Databases (DynamoDB)
    a. Scalability
    b. High Availability: Multi-AZ
    c. Anti-Patterns: requires joins or complex transactions, use relational databases (Aurora or others). If you have large binary files (audio, video, image), consider storing the files in Amazon S3.

7.2 Data Warehouse (Redshift)

    a. Scalability
    b. High Availability: Multi-AZ
    c. Anti-Patterns: not meant for OLTP

7.3 Search capabilities of AWS
    a. CloudSearch
    b. Amazon ElasticSearch
 Both the services are scalable, highly available.

 7.4 Graph databases (Amazon Neptune)
     a. Highly scalable and available
     Exam asks questions when to use graph services (Amazon Neptune).

#### 8. Managing Increasing Volumes Of Data

A data lake is an architectural approach that allows you to store massive amounts of data in a central location so that it's readily available to be categorized, processed, analyzed and consumed by diverse groups within your organization.
You can use S3, Athena etc.

#### 9. Removing Single Points of Failure
    a. Introducing Redundancy
    b. Detect failure
    c. Durable Data Storage (If you have avery important data,don't store it on S3 One Zone single AZ class)
    d. Automate multi-data centre resilience (region basis)
    e. Fault Isolation and Traditional horizontal scaling (scaling out: multiple EC2 behan ELB)
    f. Shrading (split it across multiple shrads)

#### 10. Optimized For Cost
    a. Right Sizing
    b. Elasticity
    c. Take advantage of the variety of purchasing options: reserved instances and reserved capacity, spot instances etc.

#### 11. Caching

    a. Application caching (Elasticache)
    b. Edge Caching (CDN networks)

#### 12. Security

    a. Use AWS features for Defence in Depth
    b. Share Security Responsibility with AWS
    c. Reduce privileged access
    d. Security as Code
    e. Real-time auditing (AWS inspector etc)
