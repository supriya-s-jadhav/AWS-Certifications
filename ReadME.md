# AWS-Certifications

AWS-Certifications is the collection of my personal notes, references for preparing different AWS certification exams. This repository will develop as I make progress on my AWS certifications' journey. My working experience with cloud technologies for over an year motivated me to prepare for the AWS certification exams which are very popular and in-demand in the industry at this time. I decided to make personal detailed notes about different Amazon Web Technologies and their different service offerings while preparing for the AWS certifications and save them all at one central location which I can share with the other people who are new to the cloud technology or preparing for the AWS certifications.


## List of AWS Certifications under my belt

1. AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
2. AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty 2020

## Audiences

The AWS-Certification repository is still under-development. I keep adding notes as my journey to different certification progresses.

IF you are beginner to cloud technology or IT with zero experience to less experience, this can be your guide to build a foundational knowledge. There are lot of other resources available to get hands-on experience. Best way to start with hands-on experience is by opening a basic account on AWS, which is free for initial-12 months.
